### Microfrontend Kit

This is the initial Micro-Frontend setup using Vite. For now, Iâ€™ve created host and remote folders. We are exposing a Counter Button from the remote app, which is accessible in the host app.

More details will be shared soon!

```code
remote => npm run build && npm run serve
host => npm run dev
```

Enjoy journey with me. Thanks!
